# Thoughts Taker

It's a type of a diary/notepad but with some differences to represent ones personal diary/golden thoughts. Although its primary function isn't for taking short time notes i.e shopping list, passwords etc it can be utilised for this too. The app was mainly designed for the writers, thinkers, dreamers and everyone who'd like to keep a journal.

Each note receives a date stamp for the reference.

The main difference is that once a note has been made, it cannot be deleted. However, should the note become irrelevant to tha author, it can be crossed out and likewise should it become of an importance again it can simply be put to its original state.

Many writers get inspired at odd times and very often are struggling to find a scrap of paper to write their thoughts down and because these days almost everyone has their smartphone on them it's easy to make a note and not worry about losing it.

The app is still in it's testing phase.
